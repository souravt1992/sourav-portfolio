### Port Folio Live App Link : https://souravt1992.github.io/sourav-portfolio  
  

### Deployment process for GitHub Pages

**Note**: this feature is available with react-scripts@0.2.0 and higher.  

**Step 1**: Add homepage to package.json

   *The step below is important!
    If you skip it, your app will not deploy correctly.
    Open your **package.json** and add a homepage field for your project:* 

>    "homepage": "https://souravt1992.github.io/sourav-portfolio",

 *or for a GitHub user page:*  

>  "homepage": "https://souravt1992.github.io",

*or for a custom domain page:*  

>  "homepage": "https://mywebsite.com",

*Create React App uses the homepage field to determine the root URL in the built HTML file.*  

**Step 2:** Install gh-pages and add deploy to scripts in package.json

*Now, whenever you run npm run build, you will see a cheat sheet with instructions on how to deploy to GitHub Pages.*  

To publish it at [https://souravt1992.github.io/sourav-portfolio](https://souravt1992.github.io/sourav-portfolio), run:

  

> npm install --save gh-pages

## Add the following scripts in your package.json:  

> "scripts": {
>    "predeploy": "npm run build",
>    "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",  

*The predeploy script will run automatically before deploy is run.* 
*If you are deploying to a GitHub user page instead of a project page you'll need to make one additional modification:*  

**Tweak your package.json scripts to push deployments to master:**

>     "scripts": {
>      "predeploy": "npm run build",
>     - "deploy": "gh-pages -d build",
>     + "deploy": "gh-pages -b master -d build",

**Step 3:** Deploy the site by running npm run deploy

**Then run:** 

> **npm run deploy**

*Build will be generated in master branch for Live App :)*  

**Step 4:**  For a project page, ensure your projectâ€™s settings use master

*Finally, make sure GitHub Pages option in your GitHub project settings is set to use the master branch*
